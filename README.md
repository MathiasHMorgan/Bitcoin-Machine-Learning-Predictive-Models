#Bitcoin-Machine-Learning-Predictive-Models

Objective: This project will seek to visually evaluate the performance of price predictive models for both Bitcoin (BTC) using supervised and unsupervised machine learning models.

Rationale: The primary rationale for this project is that the crypto market is relativley young and in efficient, price predition models may be able tp provide a statistical edge to investors and traders looking to exploit information assymetry and asset mispricing.

The final output of our analysis will be to visually compare the performance of different models by comparing the actual price with the predicted price over the latter portion of the time series.

Models Used:

Monte Carlo Simulation
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Learning Neural Network
- Linear Regression
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

Data: Daily time series data for BTC and ETH has been taken from https://www.alphavantage.co/ API.
