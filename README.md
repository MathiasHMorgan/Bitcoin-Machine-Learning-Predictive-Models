# Final-Project---Crypto-Predictive-Models

Objective: This project will seek to evaluate the performance of price predictive models for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) using supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. 

The final out put of our analysis will visually compare the performance of different models by comparing the actual price with the predicted price over different time series. 

Models Used:

- Monte Carlo Simulation
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Learning Neural Network
- Linear/Logistic Regression
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- Random Forest
- KNN Regression

Data: Daily time series data for BTC and ETH has been taken from https://www.alphavantage.co/ API.
